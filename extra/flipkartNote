What actually flipkart guys thinking about Expected Delivery Date? 
Is it "Expected Delivery Date" is "Exact Delivery Date" like wise flipkart guys are thinking ?
Every customer expects faster delivery if they gave any expected date it means customer can expect before that.
But every time these guys giving delivery on expected delivery data.
I don't know why they taking these much time to deliver a product Like a mobile phone also.
I placed order 17-01-22 upto 19-01-22 it was on origin city only. On 20-01-22 it showing in Vijayawada.
So they trying to reach destination city 21-01-22. that's it delivery date is expected date.
On 19-01-22 moved package delivered on 21-01-22 then why it didn't move on 17th or 18th. why it was on origin 
city upto 19-01-22 then where is flipkart fast delivery and even for plus member also same. If it is the process 
then why choose flipkart we can choose another ecomerce with better delivery.
